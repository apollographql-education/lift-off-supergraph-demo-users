# lift-off-supergraph-demo-users

This is an extremely basic user subgraph as a starting point to build the future of Catstronauts pilot license program. 

Start first with launching [lift-off-supergraph-demo-tracks](https://github.com/apollographql-education/lift-off-supergraph-demo-tracks) with `rover dev` (follow instruction on the readme there.  
Once the tracks subgraph is running, you can spin up this users subgraph in another terminal window using the `rover dev`command as well. Both subgraph will be composed locally, the router will be launched and you'll have access to the supergraph on the sandbox at `http://localhost:3000`

## Running the subgraph

in a first terminal window start your server with `npm run dev`
in a new terminal window run `rover dev` you will be prompted to enter the subgraphs url
which is `http://localhost:4002`
