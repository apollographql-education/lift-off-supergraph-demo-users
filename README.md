# Odyssey Lift-off: Destination Supergraph - users subgraph

This is a subgraph provided for you for the Odyssey Lift-off: Destination Supergraph course! You can find the [course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-supergraph/), Apollo's learning platform.

This users subgraph is meant to expand the Catstronauts supergraph.

## Running this subgraph

1. In a terminal window, install the packages.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Then, run the server.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

This will start the GraphQL server on `localhost:4002`, where you can use Apollo Sandbox to run queries.

[Follow the course instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-supergraph/) for more on how to add this subgraph to the supergraph and how to use `rover dev`.
